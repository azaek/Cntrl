Welcome to **Cntrl**.

Cntrl is a lightweight tool built to provide a quick way to check your PC stats or perform power actions from your phone while you're away from your desk.

It was designed for personal use and for people who enjoy building their own homelab dashboards or remote control setups.

### Philosophy

-   **Lightweight**: No heavy runtimes, just a single binary.
-   **Transparent**: What you see in the tray is what is running. No hidden services.

### Key Features

-   **System Monitoring**: Access CPU load, GPU temperature, RAM usage, and Disk space via a simple JSON API.
-   **Power Management**: Remotely Shutdown, Restart, or Hibernate your PC.
-   **Native Experience**: Professional Windows tray app with embedded icons and single-instance locking.
-   **Interactive Setup**: Easy-to-use installer that configures everything for you.
