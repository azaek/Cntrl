## Static IP Reservation (Important)

If you plan to control your PC from your phone or another device, you need to ensure your PC's address doesn't change over time.

Most home routers assign IP addresses dynamically (DHCP), which means your PC might be `192.168.1.10` today but `192.168.1.15` tomorrow. If that happens, your phone won't be able to find it.

### How to reserve your IP:

1.  Open your router's web interface (usually `192.168.1.1` or `192.168.0.1`).
2.  Look for a section named **DHCP Server**, **Static IP**, or **Address Reservation**.
3.  Find your PC in the list (look for "Cntrl-Host" or your Windows computer name).
4.  Click **Add** or **Reserve** to bind your PC's physical (MAC) address to a specific IP address.

    Once reserved, you can always reach your PC at the same address, making it a
    reliable "Static" endpoint for your remote dashboards.

## Launch at Startup

You can easily toggle whether Cntrl starts with Windows by right-clicking the tray icon and selecting **Run at Startup**. This creates a shortcut in your legacy Startup folder.
