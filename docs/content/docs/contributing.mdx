First off, thank you for considering contributing to Cntrl!

## Philosophy

Before you dive in, please keep in mind the project's core philosophy:

-   **Simple**: We want to keep the feature set focused.
-   **Lightweight**: Avoid adding heavy dependencies unless absolutely necessary.
-   **Windows Native**: We prioritize a clean, native experience for Windows users.

## Getting Started

To work on Cntrl locally, you'll need:

-   **Go 1.21+**
-   **Node.js** (if you're working on the documentation)

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/azaek/cntrl.git
    ```
2. Build the binary for testing:
    ```bash
    go build ./cmd/cntrl
    ```
3. To test the release flow (GoReleaser):
    ```bash
    # Requires goreleaser installed
    goreleaser build --snapshot --clean --single-target
    ```

## Documentation

The documentation is built with [Fuma Docs](https://fumadocs.dev). To run it locally:

```bash
cd docs
npm run dev
```

## Pull Requests

-   **Small is better**: We prefer small, focused pull requests.
-   **Explain the "Why"**: Include a clear description of the problem your PR solves.
-   **Consistency**: Try to follow the existing code style.

Thank you for being part of the community! 🚀
