Cntrl uses a simple `config.yaml` file to store your settings. You can open this file directly by right-clicking the tray icon and selecting **Open Config**.

## File Location

The configuration file is stored in your user's standard config folder:

- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Cntrl\config.yaml`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Cntrl/config.yaml`

## Structure

Here is a breakdown of the standard configuration options:

```yaml
server:
    host: "0.0.0.0" # Listen on all network interfaces
    port: 9990 # The HTTP port for the API

features:
    enable_stats: true # Expose /api/stats
    enable_shutdown: true # Allow /api/pw/shutdown
    enable_restart: true # Allow /api/pw/restart
    enable_sleep: true # Allow /api/pw/sleep
    enable_hibernate: true # Allow /api/pw/hibernate
```

### Server Settings

-   **`host`**: By default, this is set to `0.0.0.0` so other devices on your network can reach the API. If you only want local access on the PC itself, change it to `127.0.0.1`.
-   **`port`**: The port number. If you change this, remember to update any remote dashboards or phone apps that connect to Cntrl.

### Feature Toggles

You can enable or disable specific parts of the API.

-   If a feature is set to `false`, the corresponding API endpoint will return a `403 Forbidden` error.
-   You can also toggle these features instantly via the **Features** menu in the system tray.

> [!NOTE]
> Changes made in the Tray Menu are automatically saved to the configuration file.
