<Callout type="warn" title="Experimental">
    The processes endpoint is **experimental** and may change in future versions.
</Callout>

The `/api/processes` endpoint returns a list of running processes, aggregated by name and sorted by memory usage.

## Endpoint

| Method | URL              |
| :----- | :--------------- |
| `GET`  | `/api/processes` |

## Example Request

```bash title="Request"
curl http://192.168.1.100:9990/api/processes
```

## Response Schema

Returns the **top 20 processes** sorted by total memory usage (descending).

```json title="Response"
[
    {
        "name": "chrome.exe",
        "count": 15,
        "memory": 1572864000,
        "memory_mb": 1500.5,
        "cpu_time": 245.67
    },
    {
        "name": "brave.exe",
        "count": 8,
        "memory": 524288000,
        "memory_mb": 500.0,
        "cpu_time": 123.45
    },
    {
        "name": "Code.exe",
        "count": 3,
        "memory": 314572800,
        "memory_mb": 300.0,
        "cpu_time": 56.78
    }
]
```

## Field Reference

| Field       | Type   | Description                              |
| :---------- | :----- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `name`      | string | Process executable name.                 |
| `count`     | int    | Number of instances with this name.      |
| `memory`    | int    | Total memory usage in bytes.             |
| `memory_mb` | float  | Total memory usage in MB.                |
| `cpu_time`  | float  | Total CPU time used in seconds.          |

## Notes

<Callout type="info" title="Aggregation">
    Processes with the same name (e.g., multiple `chrome.exe` tabs) are grouped
    together. Memory and CPU time are summed across all instances.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="CPU Time vs CPU Percentage">
    `cpu_time` represents the **total** CPU time the process has consumed since
    it started (in seconds). This is different from real-time CPU percentage,
    which would require sampling over time and add overhead.
</Callout>

### Sorting

The list is sorted by total memory usage in descending order, showing the most memory-hungry processes first. Only the top 20 are returned to keep the response lightweight.
