Welcome to **Cntrl**.

Cntrl is a lightweight tool built to provide a quick way to check your PC stats or perform power actions from your phone while you're away from your desk. It runs on **Windows** and **macOS**.

It was designed for personal use and for people who enjoy building their own dashboards or remote control setups.

### Philosophy

-   **Lightweight**: No heavy runtimes, just a single binary.
-   **Transparent**: What you see in the tray is what is running. No hidden services.

### Key Features

-   **System Monitoring**: Access CPU load, GPU temperature, RAM usage, and Disk space via a simple JSON API.
-   **Power Management**: Remotely Shutdown, Restart, or put your computer to Sleep.
-   **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows and macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon).
-   **Native Experience**: Professional system tray app with embedded icons and single-instance locking.
-   **Easy Setup**: Interactive installer on Windows, drag-and-drop DMG on macOS.
