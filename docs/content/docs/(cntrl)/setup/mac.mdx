## Installation

<Steps>
<Step>
### Download

Download the appropriate DMG from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/azaek/cntrl/releases):

| DMG | Best For |
|-----|----------|
| `Cntrl_vX.X.X_macOS_Universal.dmg` | Works on all Macs (recommended) |
| `Cntrl_vX.X.X_macOS_AppleSilicon.dmg` | M1/M2/M3/M4 Macs only (smaller) |
| `Cntrl_vX.X.X_macOS_Intel.dmg` | Older Intel Macs only (smaller) |

<Callout type="info">
**Not sure which Mac you have?** Click the Apple menu → **About This Mac**. If it says "Apple M1/M2/M3/M4", you have Apple Silicon. Otherwise, you have Intel.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
    ### Install 
    1. Open the DMG file 
    2. Drag **Cntrl** to your **Applications**
    folder
</Step>

<Step>
### Launch
**Important:** After installing, you must manually open Cntrl for it to start.

1. Open **Applications** folder
2. Double-click **Cntrl**
3. The Cntrl icon will appear in your menu bar

<Callout type="info">
On first launch, macOS may show a security warning. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway**.
</Callout>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Launch at Startup

Right-click the menu bar icon and select **Run at Startup**. This creates a LaunchAgent that starts Cntrl when you log in.

## Verify It's Working

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:9990/api/status
```

You should see `{"status":"ok"}`.
