### Why "Cntrl"?

The name represents the core purpose of the app: giving you **Control** over your PC from anywhere in your home network. It's a bridge between your Windows machine and whatever remote dashboard or mobile app you're using.

### What are the main use cases?

<Steps>
    <Step>
        **Home Monitoring**: Check your PC stats (CPU Temp, GPU Load) while
        you're in the next room without having to walk back to your desk.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **Remote Power**: Turn off or hibernate your PC from your phone after
        you've finished a movie or when you realized you left it on.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **Dashboard Integration**: Cntrl provides raw JSON data, making it
        perfect for custom home automation dashboards built with Home Assistant,
        Dashy, or custom React apps.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Why is it Windows only?

Cntrl is built using the Windows API to provide a deep, native integration—including direct control over hardware stats and power states without external background services. While the core logic is Go, the "soul" of the app is optimized for the Windows ecosystem.

### Why Go?

We chose Go for its ability to produce a **single, small binary** with zero dependencies. You don't need to install Python, Node.js, or any background runtimes to use Cntrl. Just the `.exe`.

### Is it secure?

<Callout type="warn">
    As mentioned in the [Introduction](/docs), Cntrl does not have built-in
    authentication. It is intended for **local network use only**. Do not expose
    your Cntrl port to the public internet.
</Callout>

### Can I change the port?

Yes! You can change it during the installation process or by editing the `config.yaml` file manually (accessible via the tray menu).
